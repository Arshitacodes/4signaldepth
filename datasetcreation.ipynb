    "We create random RTL Verilog modules (e.g., simple combinational, deep pipelines, high fan-in) with varying parameters. Each module is synthesized using Yosys to gather features like gate counts and combinational depth. We then combine the generated code, expected features, and extracted synthesis data into a JSON dataset, ready for machine learning or analysis."
